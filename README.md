# CS112
Listed below are the projects I completed for CS112(Data Structures) at Rutgers along with a short description of each project.
## BigInteger
* A program that implements a BigInteger, a data type that can store numbers larger than the `int` data type is able to.
* Will parse signed numerical values and is able to perform basic operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication given two numbers.
* This implementation uses linked list nodes to store digits of given numbers.

## Expression
* A program that parses an infix expression that may contain integer constants, variables, arrays, any operator, and parenthesized subexpressions.
* My implementation uses Dijkstra's Shunting Yard Algorithm to construct a binary expression tree from infix. 

## Trie
* Implements the Trie data structure to store an array of words through the use of linked lists.
* Also contains a method that efficiently searches for words that start with a given prefix.
